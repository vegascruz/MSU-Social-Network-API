  ## Installation
  Go to my Github link which will be provided at the bottom, download the code, update the connection for your best fit. Then run these commands in the terminal, make sure you are in the main folder
  -npm i (this is to install all the necessary packages)
  -npm start

  Then you can either run the code in the browser on localhost or use the insomnia app to run GET, PUT, PUSH, and DELETE requests.

  ## Motivation
  This was a class assignment that turned out to be quite fun! First time using MongoDB and it was a little tough at first, but became easier the more I worked with it.

  ## Why?
  Coding bootcamp project

  ## Problem Solved?
  It is good starter code for an up and coming company. Can use this as a model for a social networking app.

  ## Things Learned
  MongoDB was completely new to me, so I learned how to use the MongoDB Compass and I learned how to create a conenction from my app to the database. I then was able to run it on the localhost and see data on Insomnia.
